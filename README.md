UW Bootcamp W2 (Timed) Quiz Assignment

## Assignment
Create a timed, multiple-choice quiz that reduces the player's time when the wrong answer is selected. Selecting any answer advances the quiz to the next question.

The game is over when the time runs out, or all the questions are answered.

I also elected to give the player a point for every correct answer, so they could track how many they got correct as they progressed. Timer counts down, points count up (hopefully).

At the end of the quiz, the remaining time is added to the points the player scored and the player is then presented with a list of high scores. Here the player can enter their name (or initials), pressing enter to submit. There are 2 options presented at the bottom of the list: clear scores, and play again.
